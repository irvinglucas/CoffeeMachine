# Coffee Machine
This project is part of the [Kotlin Basics](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18) track on Jetbrains Academy. This track 
consists of a lot of topics about the Kotlin programming language. The track is also project-oriented, because 
you 
learn a 
selection of topics to apply in a project of your choice. I chose this one because it has a lot of topics to learn 
before start coding, and also because with those I could apply them in other projects outsite Jetbrains academy, and 
be more prepared for job interviews.

### With this machine, you can:

* Buy coffee (Espresso, Latte or Cappuccino)
* Check remaining supplies inside the machine
* Fill the machine with supplies (water, milk, coffee beans and disposable cups)
* Take the money earned away

### More about the development of this project

This project was a way to put in practice almost everything I've been learning so far in the [Kotlin Basics](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18) track on Jetbrains Academy.

### Concepts used in this project:
* OOP
* Machine States
* enums
* Code conventions (a lot of them actually)

# And that's it! :)
